6,"Weekly Bitchcoin Update on the crypto markets - Stay Sharp, Stay Sassy 💅

• Ethereum's Mega Haul: Some big paws just grabbed 330,705 ETH—worth a cool $883M— the highest amount ever in a single day. Someone's stacking for a serious moon mission. 🚀 🚀

• Coinbase CEO's Transparent Dream: Brian Armstrong wants a blockchain-based U.S. Treasury to make government spending as clear as a freshly washed dog bowl. 🐕

• Trump's Move on Crypto: The prez just dropped an executive order pushing digital assets while slamming the door on a U.S. central bank digital currency (CBDC). The fear? A CBDC could give the government too much control over people's funds. Love him or hate him, this move is making waves in the crypto kennel. 🔥 🔥

• XRP & Solana's ETF Sprint: These two are gunning for spot ETFs—will we finally see a memecoin ETF soon? One can dream.

• Crypto Mom Levels Up: Hester Peirce, aka Crypto Mom, just took the reins at the SEC's new Crypto Focus Section. She's on a mission to keep the fraudsters out while letting real innovation thrive—because regulation shouldn't mean strangulation. Way to go Hester! ⭐ 🎉 🚀

• Fear & Greed Index Check: The CMC market is sitting at 35 (Fear)—other indexes show 45, slightly higher but still in fear mode. As the saying goes, when markets serve fear, it's time to grab a plate. Buffet-style stacking season is open—load up before greed takes the table. 1️⃣ 🚀

• DOGE.gov? Memes Gone Pro: DOGE now has an official gov website (doge.gov) and is building its own L1 blockchain. Oh, With a $37B market cap—bigger than Ford and many S&P500 giants— DOGE is proving community-driven crypto can compete with the big dogs globally. 🐕 🚀
